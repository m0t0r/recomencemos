/**
 * **`RateCounter`** — per principal, per action, per window. The spec's own
 * description is "boring, and NFR26 rests on it", and boring is why it is the
 * first table: it is the only entity in this effort that is plumbing rather than
 * a story, so it does not take DDL out of a later slice's vertical cut. The
 * `./rate-limit` module that reads and writes it ships with its first ceiling
 * (#12, `requestMagicLink ≤ 5/hour per address`).
 *
 * **`BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, and `mode: "bigint"`.** DD2 makes a
 * UUIDv7 the exception rather than the rule — 16 bytes against 8, widening every
 * index and every foreign key that references it — and reserves it for ids that
 * reach a URL or a browser. Nothing about a rate counter does. Reading the key
 * as a JavaScript `BigInt` rather than a `number` is exact where `number` is
 * lossy past 2^53, and it has a second effect worth keeping: `JSON.stringify`
 * throws on a `BigInt`, so a key that was never meant to cross a boundary cannot
 * be serialised into one by accident.
 *
 * **`action` now carries the `CHECK` this comment used to promise.** DD2 makes
 * enum-shaped columns `TEXT` with a `CHECK (col IN (...))` precisely so that
 * widening the set is a constraint change rather than a type alteration, and the
 * set was empty until the slice that added the first ceiling. #12 is that slice:
 * `requestMagicLink` is the one member, and the other seven NFR26 names arrive
 * as one-line constraint changes beside the ceiling they belong to. The
 * authority on the set is `CEILINGS` in `./rate-limit`; this constraint is the
 * database refusing what that registry does not know.
